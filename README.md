# DS2-Project
The goal of this project is to implement various hashing techniques and analyze the performance of each of the techniques implemented. The techniques that have been implemented in this project are linear probing, quadratic probing and cuckoo hashing.   
   
 In order to compare these techniques, we first chose a dataset from kaggle. The dataset contains life expectancy data of all the countries, and each country has multiple records, because each country has it's life expectancy data for several years. The first step we did in this project was to create a new csv file, that is named as Clean File.csv. The new csv file removes all the unnecessary data and only includes the latest record for each country.
