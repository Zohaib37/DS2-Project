# DS2-Project
The goal of this project is to implement various hashing techniques and analyze the performance of each of the techniques implemented. The techniques that have been implemented in this project are linear probing, quadratic probing and cuckoo hashing.   
   
 In order to compare these techniques, we first chose a dataset from kaggle. The dataset contains life expectancy data of all the countries, and each country has multiple records, because each country has it's life expectancy data for several years. The first step we did in this project was to create a new csv file, that is named as Clean File.csv. The new csv file removes all the unnecessary data and only includes the latest record for each country. We then loop over the clean file, and hash each country and it's corresponding life expectancy value in two hash tables, one for the country, and the other for the life expectancy value. Collisions are resolved using three different techniques, linear probing, quadratic probing, and cuckoo hashing that are each implemented within their own class. When the program is run, the user is asked to input the name of country for which they want the life expectancy value. The program then fetches the value using the three techniques mentioned, and outputs the value, along with the time it took to fetch the value through each of the three techniques. This helps in comparing and analyzing the performance of these techniques.
